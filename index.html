<h1>
<a name="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this?</h1>
</li>
</ul><p>This is a "release quality" release of StrangeBrew Java, which means 
it's feature-complete, and is pretty stable.  If you find bugs, please
report them via the Github Project. Or email a developer above</p>

<p>StrangeBrew Java is a Java port of the popular Windows homebrewing
software, StrangeBrew (<a href="http://www.strangebrew.ca">www.strangebrew.ca</a>).</p>

<p>Ingredients can now be added/edited from the application, removing the
need to edit the data files directly.</p>

<p>NOTE: We've changed the numbering of Java releases to 2.0, based on 
the idea that this is a continuation of the Windows version 1.8.</p>

<h1>
<a name="-running-strangebrew-java" class="anchor" href="#-running-strangebrew-java"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a> Running StrangeBrew Java</h1>

<p>Running StrangeBrew:
1. Unzip the sb_XXX.zip file (where XXX is the latest version, eg: "sb_2.0.1").
Be sure to preserve the directory structure.
2. Type "java -jar strangebrew.jar" at the command line.  Under Windows,
you can right-click this file, select "Open With &gt; " and select a Java
installation. You can also just double-click the file, if ".jar" files
are associated with javaw.exe.  Double-clicking reportedly also works on
Mac OSX.  There's probably a Linux way to do this, but I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>NOTE: StrangeBrew loads data (ingredients, styles, etc) from:
src/ca/strangebrew/data/
When you unzip the file, be sure to preserve directory names, so
that StrangeBrew can find this data.</p>

<h1>
<a name="extra-help-for-running-on-linux" class="anchor" href="#extra-help-for-running-on-linux"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extra help for running on Linux</h1>

<p><strong>I do not recommend this, just use <code>java -jar strangebrew.jar</code></strong></p>

<p>These are notes from Scott Alfter via rec.crafts.brewing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC is enabled in the kernel (built-in or
module)...look in Executable file formats/Emulations -&gt; Kernel support
for MISC binaries. </li>
<li>Add the following to /etc/fstab:
binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc defaults 0 0</li>
<li>Create /usr/bin/jexec with the following contents and make it executable
by everybody:
#!/bin/sh
java -jar $*</li>
<li>Add the following to whatever script your distro provides for local
customization (in Gentoo, it's /etc/conf.d/local.start):
echo ':jarexec:M::PK\x03\x04::/usr/bin/jexec:' &gt;/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register</li>
</ol><p>When you reboot (or if you execute the preceding from a root prompt), you
can chmod 755 strangeBrew_fat.jar and then run it with the following:</p>

<p>./strangeBrew_fat.jar</p>

<p>NOTE: At least one person has experienced problems running StrangeBrew on Fedora
using their 1.4.2 JRE, which is the GNU gcj.  The problem was solved by using the
1.5 JRE from Sun.  </p>

<p>For Ubuntu:
Install Sun's JRE:
    $ sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
Update default system JVM:
    $ sudo update-alternatives --config java
  Select java-6 from the list
    $ sudo update-alternatives --config jar
  Select java-6 from the list</p>

<p>See <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java</a> for more help with Ubuntu.</p>

<p><strong>This bug below is fixed</strong></p>

<p>Greg LaPolla points out:
When you create a launcher on the desktop and start the app with the java -jar 
command it displays the "can't find the database" error.  You can create a shell
script to fix it by simply changing to the StrangeBrew directory first:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
cd ~/StrangeBrew
java -jar StrangeBrew.jar
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a name="setting-the-look-and-feel" class="anchor" href="#setting-the-look-and-feel"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setting the Look and Feel</h1>

<p>The Java Swing library (which StrangeBrew uses for its user interface) supports
a "pluggable look and feel" (LAF) -- meaning you can easily change the appearance 
of Swing applications to suit your own tastes.  </p>

<p>The default is the System Look and Feel, this means that the application should 
fairly closely match your Operating Systems Look &amp; Feel (there are some exceptions,
such as KDE based environments)</p>

<p>(Some betas of StrangeBrew used the JGoodies Looks LAF, but I removed
it as the default to give users more control over how the application looks).</p>

<p>Very nice look and feels are available on-line from several sources.  Here are 
a few of my favourites for StrangeBrew:</p>

<ul>
<li>JGoodies Looks: <a href="http://javootoo.l2fprod.com/plaf/jgoodies/index.php">http://javootoo.l2fprod.com/plaf/jgoodies/index.php</a>
</li>
<li>Liquid L&amp;F: <a href="https://liquidlnf.dev.java.net/">https://liquidlnf.dev.java.net/</a>
</li>
<li>Synthetica L&amp;F: <a href="http://www.javasoft.de/jsf/public/products/synthetica">http://www.javasoft.de/jsf/public/products/synthetica</a>
</li>
<li>Tonic L&amp;F: <a href="http://www.digitprop.com/p.php?page=toniclf">http://www.digitprop.com/p.php?page=toniclf</a>
</li>
</ul><p>Download the .jar file you'd like to try, and put it in your Java home directory under
/lib/ext.</p>

<p>You can set the Look and Feel in a couple of ways:</p>

<p>1) From the Command-line:
Use the -Dswing.defaultlaf= option when starting the application.
Here's an example of starting StrangeBrew using the Synthetica LAF:</p>

<p><code>java -Dswing.defaultlaf=de.javasoft.plaf.synthetica.SyntheticaStandardLookAndFeel -jar strangebrew.jar</code></p>

<p>The "de.javasoft.plaf.synthetica.SyntheticaStandardLookAndFeel" bit is the full class 
name of the Look And Feel -- you'll have to read the documentation for each LAF to find 
out the proper text to put here</p>

<p>2) Using swing.properties:
You can set the default LAF for all Java Swing applications by editing the swing.properties
file in your $JAVA_HOME/lib directory.  You need to add two lines for your new LAF, and
change the default line.  Here's an example of the new &amp; changed lines using the Tonic
LAF:</p>

<pre><code>swing.installedlaf.tonic.name = Tonic
swing.installedlaf.tonic.class = com.digitprop.tonic.TonicLookAndFeel
swing.defaultlaf=com.digitprop.tonic.TonicLookAndFeel
</code></pre>

<p>3) Using the preferences options. Under the "Brewer" pane you can select from any of the L&amp;Fs installed 
on your system. This gets saved.</p>

<p>Now start StrangeBrew as you would normally, and it should use the new LAF.</p>

<h1>
<a name="files-" class="anchor" href="#files-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Files </h1>

<p>The file you downloaded should contain these files (at least):</p>

<ul>
<li>strangebrew.jar: a Fat Jar file which you can run (see above).  This
file also contains the complete Java source for the application.  To
view the source, decompress this file with an archive utility.</li>
<li>gpl.txt: the GPL license this software is distributed under</li>
<li>readme.txt: this file</li>
<li>src/ca/strangebrew/data: data files and the xslt files required 
for exporting HTML and printing.  You can modify the xslt files if 
you want to customize the look of the HTML.</li>
<li>help/: help files.  These files are under development.</li>
<li>recipes/: example recipe files in various formats.<br>
</li>
<li>src/*: all the Java files you need to build and run StrangeBrew yourself.<br>
You will need to either download or extract a couple of other .jar files 
that StrangeBrew requires.</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="required-jre" class="anchor" href="#required-jre"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Required JRE</h1>

<p>You require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your system to run
StrangeBrew.  It requires versions 1.5 and up (See 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/index.jsp">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/index.jsp</a>). As of version 2.0.1, 
StrangeBrew no longer runs under version 1.4.   StrangeBrew has
been tested and runs on Linux, MacOS-X, and Windows.  </p>

<h1>
<a name="known-issues" class="anchor" href="#known-issues"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known Issues</h1>

<ul>
<li>When importing recipes from StrangeBrew for Windows (1.8 or earlier),
fermentables that are sugars are incorrectly considered "grains".  Their
gravity contribution is calculated using the recipe efficiency, rather than
100%.  You should uncheck the "M" (for mashed) column, which indicates that
the ingredient is a sugar.  This applies to all sugar-type fermentables, such
as honey, DME, LME, maple syrup, and sugars.</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="running-from-eclipse" class="anchor" href="#running-from-eclipse"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running from Eclipse</h1>

<p>StrangeBrew.launch in the repository contains the Run configurations listed here.</p>

<p>Add a new Run or debug configuration with 
<code>ca.strangebrew.ui.swing.dialogs.Splash</code></p>

<p>As the Main class, then you need to add the build directory to the Configuration, you may need to run a build first and refresh the eclipse directory</p>

<p>Class Path -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Add Folder -&gt; find the "Build" directory</p>

<p>New Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>StrangeBrew no longer uses the JGoodies Look And Feel by default, as this was
causing some refresh issues on older versions of Mac OSX.  Instead, you can set
the LAF yourself. (See the "Setting the Look And Feel" section above).</li>
<li>You can now set the bottom of temp ranges used to determine mashout and sparge
steps.  The defaults are 161F for mashout, and 170F for sparge.  This means that
when you add a mashout step, it uses the middle of the range (161 + 170 / 2, or
165.5F) when you add a mashout step, and if you change the start temp to &lt;161, it
becomes a different step type.  You can adjust these numbers to suit your mashing
preferences.</li>
<li>More and better StrangeBrew Java-specific help.<br>
</li>
<li>New Print toolbar button.</li>
</ul><p>Bugs Fixed:</p>

<ul>

</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="20b7" class="anchor" href="#20b7"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.0.b7</h2>

<p>New Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can now apply default mash schedules on the Mash tab to quickly load
a popular schedule.  You can also save the current schedule to the list of
defaults.  You can edit the /data/mashdefaults.csv file by hand to add or 
remove a default schedule.</li>
<li>The Resize Recipe dialog now allows you to also convert hops and fermentables
(Bug 1489903).</li>
<li>New potential extract calculator.<br>
</li>
<li>You can now add sparge steps to a mash schedule.  Add a step, and change the 
type to "sparge".  If you add more than one sparge step, it's automatically
considered a batch sparge, and correct additions are calculated.<br>
</li>
<li>You can now set the parameters for a thick and thin decoction on the 
settings tab.</li>
<li>You can now add cereal mash steps to a mash schedule.  Add a step, and change the
method to "cereal mash".  Enter the weight of the grain used in the cereal mash.
Other values will update accordingly.  Note: the temperature of the step is adjusted
if the cereal mash addition brings the step above the targe temp.  Try
decreasing the weight and adjusting the temperature until you get the values you
want.<br>
</li>
<li>New Refractometer Utility lets you peform various calculations with readings
from a refractometer.<br>
</li>
</ul><p>Bugs Fixed:</p>

<ul>

<li>You can now set boil units (C or F) as well as boil temp on the Preferences
dialog (Bug 1489250)</li>
<li>Cost tab now re-calculates correctly when values change (Bug 1493994)</li>
<li>Final beer volume shown on cost tab now matches volume shown on water tab (Bug 1493294)</li>
<li>BU:GU ratio is now displayed correctly on the Style panel (Bug 1493283).</li>
<li>Dilution panel is now updated when you first open a recipe (Bug 1492475).</li>
<li>Setting pre-boil amount now correctly updates post-boil amount.</li>
<li>Changing mash temp units to C now correctly converts tun loss (Bug 1492220).</li>
<li>Yeast now imports in BeerXML recipes. (Note: if there's more than one yeast
listed, only the last is imported w/ the recipe).</li>
<li>Find toolbar button now works (Bug 1489274).<br>
</li>
<li>Water panel numbers now aligned (Bug 1493293).</li>
<li>On the preferences dialog, when you select a constant evaporation rate, the
units are correctly displayed as the current default recipe volume units 
(Bug 1493263).</li>
<li>Removed the extra note area on the notes tab (Bug 1493286).</li>
<li>Malts with a weight of 0 are correctly displayed as being 0% (Bug 1493276).<br>
</li>
<li>Malt and hop amounts are rounded to 2 decimal places instead of 1 (Bug 1493281).</li>
<li>Preferences are saved in the right place on non-Windows machines.</li>
<li>Misc ingredient table column widths are now nicer (Bug 1493284).</li>
<li>%alc, ibu, colour method combos are wider so text isn't cut off (Bug 1489271).</li>
<li>Switching between % and constant evaporation doesn't redraw the Preferences
tab. (Bug 1493266)</li>
<li>
<p>Mash tab now shows step volume and temp. (Bug 1489258)  </p>

<a name="building-the-project" class="anchor" href="#building-the-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building the project</h1>

<p>Complete StrangeBrew Java source is included in the strangebrew.jar file.
StrangeBrew Java source is also available via github</p>

<p>(<a href="http://github.com/DougEdey/StrangeBrew)%5BGithub">http://github.com/DougEdey/StrangeBrew)[Github</a> Repo] for more information.</p>

<p>I'm building the project in Eclipse, which is freely available at eclipse.org.<br>
Once you've un-archived the source from the jar file (or obtained it from cvs), you
can import it as a new project into Eclipse.  You'll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>add the 3rd party .jar files in /lib (in the strangebrew.jar archive) to the 
project libraries</li>
<li>add an appropriate Sun JRE (1.5+) to the project libraries, if one is not already
selected</li>
</ul><p>That should be all you need to build and run the program.</p>

<p>If you wish to build the application from Ant, Greg LaPolla has kindly contributed
a build file (build.xml in the top level of the source tree).  This file has three
targets:</p>

<ul>
<li>ant build - build the application</li>
<li>ant clean - clean the workspace</li>
<li>ant zip - build a zip file for distribution.  You have to edit
the version.num property at the top of the build.xml file.  This build target
also unpacks the other jars and incorporates them into the distributable
jar and it also creates the manifest file. </li>
