Change Log:

Jan 5, 2008 - Jim Clark
- Down to 8 Type safty warrnings by implemeing various Collection<Type> stuff. The ones that are
   left are because of type casting wierdness that isn't Java best pratices.. but still works. They
   will have to be reimplemented to fix.
- Moved prime sugar and keg presure calcs into Recipe from UI
- Moved water treatment/acid/salt calcs into recipe
- Added acid to save/load/xlst printing
- Acid pulls values from source and target water (perhaps a bad thing?)

- Consolidated a lot of fixed strings scatetred though out app into static strings to
   help prevent fat fingers and what not and to create more readable code. Still more to
   do, especialy in Quantity(), but I got most of them.
