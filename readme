StrangeBrew Java - Beta 1

Thank you for downloading and trying StrangeBrew Java.

This is an "beta" release of StrangeBrew Java, which means it's
still in development and may have some bugs.  
Please use it for your brewday planning, and let us know
how you like it!

StrangeBrew Java is a Java port of the popular Windows homebrewing
software, StrangeBrew (www.strangebrew.ca).

Running StrangeBrew:
1. Unzip the sbjar_XXX.zip file (where XXX is the latest version, eg: "beta1").
The file contains the data directory (src/strangebrew/data/) and the
StrangeBrew java archive (StrangeBrew_fat.jar).
2. Type "java -jar StrangeBrew_fat.jar" at the command line.  Under Windows,
you can right-click this file, select "Open With > " and select a Java
installation. There's probably a Mac way to do this, but I don't know
what it is.

You require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your system to run
StrangeBrew.  It should run with versions 1.4 and up; I'm using
1.5.02. (See http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/index.jsp).

Bugs:
We're using the Sourceforge tracking feature to track bugs.  Please go to 
www.sourceforge.net/projects/strangebrew and click on "bugs" to view a list
of reported bugs.  If you've found one that's not there, please report it!
