StrangeBrew Java - Early Alpha

This is an early alpha release of StrangeBrew Java, which means it's
buggy, and doesn't have many features.  At this point it's a proof-of-
concept and snapshot into current development for anyone who's curious
about the software.

StrangeBrew Java is a Java port of the popular Windows homebrewing
software, StrangeBrew (www.strangebrew.ca).

Running StrangeBrew:

- Unzip the sbjar_alpha1a.zip file.
- The file contains the data directory (src/strangebrew/data/) and the
StrangeBrew java archive (StrangeBrew_fat.jar).
- Type "java -jar StrangeBrew_fat.jar" at the command line.  Under Windows,
you can right-click this file, select "Open With > " and select a Java
installation. There's probably a Mac way to do this, but I don't know
what it is.

You require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your system to run
StrangeBrew.  It should run with versions 1.4 and up; I'm using
1.5.02. (See http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/index.jsp).

Current Features:

Here's what you can do:
- open StrangeBrew xml recipes
- open QBrew .qbrew recipes (there are sample recipes in the data
directory)
- save StrangeBrewJ xml recipes (these are not compatible with the
Windows version of StrangeBrew)
- save recipes as html
- create a new, empty recipe

Other basic features like setting options, the mash manager, cost
tracking, database editing, etc, are all in development.
