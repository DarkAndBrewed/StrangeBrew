===============
 What is this?
===============

This is a "beta" release of StrangeBrew Java, which means it's
still in development and may have some bugs.  
Please use it for your brewday planning, and let us know
how you like it!

StrangeBrew Java is a Java port of the popular Windows homebrewing
software, StrangeBrew (www.strangebrew.ca).

==========================
 Running StrangeBrew Java
==========================

Running StrangeBrew:
1. Unzip the sb_XXX.zip file (where XXX is the latest version, eg: "beta1").
Be sure to preserve the directory structure.
2. Type "java -jar StrangeBrew_fat.jar" at the command line.  Under Windows,
you can right-click this file, select "Open With > " and select a Java
installation. You can also just double-click the file, if ".jar" files
are associated with javaw.exe.  There's probably a Mac/Linux way to do this, 
but I don't know what it is.

NOTE: StrangeBrew loads data (ingredients, styles, etc) from:
src/ca/strangebrew/data/
When you unzip the file, be sure to preserve directory names, so
that StrangeBrew can find this data.

===============================
Extra help for running on Linux
===============================

These are notes from Scott Alfter via rec.crafts.brewing:

1) Make sure CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC is enabled in the kernel (built-in or
   module)...look in Executable file formats/Emulations -> Kernel support
   for MISC binaries.
2) Add the following to /etc/fstab:
   binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc defaults 0 0
3) Create /usr/bin/jexec with the following contents and make it executable
   by everybody:
   #!/bin/sh
   java -jar $*
4) Add the following to whatever script your distro provides for local
   customization (in Gentoo, it's /etc/conf.d/local.start):
   echo ':jarexec:M::PK\x03\x04::/usr/bin/jexec:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

When you reboot (or if you execute the preceding from a root prompt), you
can chmod 755 StrangeBrew_fat.jar and then run it with the following:

./StrangeBrew_fat.jar


==========
Files 
==========

The file you downloaded should contain these files (at least):
  * src.zip: complete Java source
  * Strangebrew_fat.jar: a Fat Jar file which you can run (see above)
  * gpl.txt: the GPL license this software is distributed under
  * readme.txt: this file
  * src/ca/strangebrew/data: data files and the xslt file required 
    for exporting HTML.  You can modify the xslt file if you want to
    customize the look of the HTML.
  * help/: help files.  These are the SB Windows help files, and will
    eventually be updated to SB Java.  Some of the information pertains to
    the Java version, though, as the two versions share a similiar interface.
  * recipes/: example recipe files in various formats.    


============
Required JRE
============

You require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your system to run
StrangeBrew.  It should run with versions 1.4 and up; I'm using
1.5.06. (See http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/index.jsp).  StrangeBrew has
been tested and runs on Linux, MacOS-X, and Windows.

=======
Bugs
=======

We're using the Sourceforge tracking feature to track bugs.  Please go to 
www.sourceforge.net/projects/strangebrew and click on "bugs" to view a list
of reported bugs.  If you've found one that's not there, please report it!

==========
What's New
==========

Beta 0.5
--------

Fixed in Beta 0.5:
- Hop and fermentable costs are calculated by using the units for the ingredient,
  not oz and lbs.
- Mash table now displays temps to only 1 decimal when you convert between F and C.
- The colour patch now displays correctly when the colour method is set to EBC.
- When you select "Save" or "Save As...", StrangeBrew now suggests a file name, and
  adds ".xml" to the file name for you.

---- TOFIX: ----
- recalcs on water tab (decimal formatting?)
- apply colour method when closing prefs
- hop & malt units dropdowns
- PM misc import
- qbrew misc import


Beta 0.4
--------
- You can now import Promash and BeerXML (BeerSmith) recipes.  Just select
  the file from the "Open" dialog.  Note: not all Promash data is imported. 
  This is a short list of items not read: misc ingredients; decoction steps;
  style data; water details; custom mash schedules.
  BeerXML files can contain multiple recipes; using File > Open opens just
  the last recipe in the file.  When you point the Find dialog at a directory
  containing a BeerXML file with multiple recipes, all the recipes show up in the
  list.  Use this dialog to select other recipes in a BeerXML file.
- The cost panel is now fully implemented.  
- The colour preferences are now fully implemented.  Depending on your system,
  one of RGB calculation methods may work better than the other.
- New Resize Dialog to scale your recipe. Note: With some IBU estimation methods
  (Tinseth and Garetz), IBUs change slightly on resize - this will be fixed in 
  a future release.
- Example recipes and data files are now located two different locations.  
- The UI now uses the JGoodies Plastic3D Look and Feel.

Beta 0.3
--------
- New colour swatch to estimate the beer colour (this is a
  rough guide only!)
- Pellet hops IBUs are now calculated using the "additional IBUs %"
  setting, to account for higher utilization
- Settable look and feel (on the Appearance panel of the Preferences
  dialog).
- "Jumpy" UI behaviour is fixed (I think).
- Window sizes for Mash Manager and Preferences are a bit larger, so
  text isn't cut off.
- You are now propted to save a recipe on close.  
- New mash and water use panels replace the Mash Manager.
- *New Cost panel for tracking recipe cost.  
- *Improved RGB colour estimation - you can choose which method to use.
- Improved hops list (complete descriptions).
- Improved styles list - now read from the official BJCP 2004 styleguide
  (in xml)
  
*Not yet fully implemented!  

Beta 0.2
--------
- New water usage stats on the Mash Manager dialog
- New Malt Percent dialog lets you specify the % of each malt 
  to hit a target OG or total grain bill
- You can now specify the boil temp (in F) both on the Preferences
  dialog, and on the Mash Manager  
- Improved error handling  
- Evaporation can now be calculated as a % rather than
  a constant.
- You can set hop and malt total units  
- Improved decoction calculations - you can now specify thick and thin
  decoctions


Beta 0.1
--------
- New dilution panel to manage wort dilution
- New style panel to check style conformance
- New Preferences dialog to set defaults and preferences

  
=========
 Roadmap
=========

Soon-to-be Implemented Features:
x- edit ingredient databases (just edit w/ text editor)
- mash tun thermal mass
- hop scaling
- specify decoction thickness value
- real application help (not the SB Win version)
- sparge calculations (fly and batch)
- mash/steep indicators on malt list
- add new ingredients on open/import

Planned StrangeBrew Java Pro Features:
- water profiling
- carbonation
- refractometer utilities
- inventory tracking
- brewday timeline generation
- brew sessions (vs recipes)
- saved mash schedules
- alternate malt/hop selection dialog

(StrangeBrew Java will be released under a "dual-license": a free 
Open Source version and a commercial "Pro" version that will 
include some additional functionality.)
