StrangeBrew Java - Beta 0.4
(c)2000-2006 Drew Avis - drew.avis@gmail.com

Thank you for downloading and trying StrangeBrew Java.

This is an "beta" release of StrangeBrew Java, which means it's
still in development and may have some bugs.  
Please use it for your brewday planning, and let us know
how you like it!

StrangeBrew Java is a Java port of the popular Windows homebrewing
software, StrangeBrew (www.strangebrew.ca).

Running StrangeBrew:
1. Unzip the sb_XXX.zip file (where XXX is the latest version, eg: "beta1").
Be sure to preserve the directory structure.
2. Type "java -jar StrangeBrew_fat.jar" at the command line.  Under Windows,
you can right-click this file, select "Open With > " and select a Java
installation. You can also just double-click the file, if ".jar" files
are associated with javaw.exe.  There's probably a Mac/Linux way to do this, 
but I don't know what it is.

NOTE: StrangeBrew loads data (ingredients, styles, etc) from:
src/ca/strangebrew/data/
When you unzip the file, be sure to preserve directory names, so
that StrangeBrew can find this data.

The file you downloaded should contain these files (at least):
  * src.zip: complete Java source
  * Strangebrew_fat.jar: a Fat Jar file which you can run (see above)
  * gpl.txt: the GPL license this software is distributed under
  * readme.txt: this file
  * src/ca/strangebrew/data: data files and example recipes, and
    the xslt file required for exporting HTML

You require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your system to run
StrangeBrew.  It should run with versions 1.4 and up; I'm using
1.5.02. (See http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/index.jsp).  StrangeBrew has
been tested and runs on Linux, MacOS-X, and Windows.

NOTE: You can set the Java "Look and Feel" of StrangeBrew when you start it
from the command line.  For example:
"java -Dswing.defaultlaf=de.javasoft.plaf.synthetica.SyntheticaStandardLookAndFeel -jar StrangeBrew_fat.jar"
Make sure you put the look and feel .jar file in your JRE's /lib/ext/ directory.
I really like Synthetica (http://javasoft.de/jsf/public/products/synthetica).  There
are lots of interesting free Look and Feels out there.
You can also set the Look and Feel by editing your swing.properties file; see:
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/plaf.html#properties


Bugs:
We're using the Sourceforge tracking feature to track bugs.  Please go to 
www.sourceforge.net/projects/strangebrew and click on "bugs" to view a list
of reported bugs.  If you've found one that's not there, please report it!

What's new in:

Beta 0.4:
- You can now import Promash and BeerXML (BeerSmith) recipes.  Just select
  the file from the "Open" dialog.  Note: not all Promash data is imported. 
  This is a short list of items not read: misc ingredients; decoction steps;
  style data; water details; custom mash schedules.
  BeerXML files can contain multiple recipes; using File > Open opens just
  the last recipe in the file.  When you point the Find dialog at a directory
  containing a BeerXML file with multiple recipes, all the recipes show up in the
  list.  Use this dialog to select other recipes in a BeerXML file.
- The cost panel is now fully implemented.  
- The colour preferences are now fully implemented.  Depending on your system,
  one of RBG calculation methods may work better than the other.

Beta 0.3:
- New colour swatch to estimate the beer colour (this is a
  rough guide only!)
- Pellet hops IBUs are now calculated using the "additional IBUs %"
  setting, to account for higher utilization
- Settable look and feel (on the Appearance panel of the Preferences
  dialog).
- "Jumpy" UI behaviour is fixed (I think).
- Window sizes for Mash Manager and Preferences are a bit larger, so
  text isn't cut off.
- You are now propted to save a recipe on close.  
- New mash and water use panels replace the Mash Manager.
- *New Cost panel for tracking recipe cost.  
- *Improved RGB colour estimation - you can choose which method to use.
- Improved hops list (complete descriptions).
- Improved styles list - now read from the official BJCP 2004 styleguide
  (in xml)
  
*Not yet fully implemented!  

Beta 0.2:
- New water usage stats on the Mash Manager dialog
- New Malt Percent dialog lets you specify the % of each malt 
  to hit a target OG or total grain bill
- You can now specify the boil temp (in F) both on the Preferences
  dialog, and on the Mash Manager  
- Improved error handling  
- Evaporation can now be calculated as a % rather than
  a constant.
- You can set hop and malt total units  
- Improved decoction calculations - you can now specify thick and thin
  decoctions


Beta 0.1:
- New dilution panel to manage wort dilution
- New style panel to check style conformance
- New Preferences dialog to set defaults and preferences

  
Soon-to-be Implemented Features:
x- edit ingredient databases (just edit w/ text editor)
- mash tun thermal mass
- recipe resize / unit conversion
- hop scaling
- alternate malt/hop selection dialog
- specify decoction thickness value
- application help
- sparge calculations (fly and batch)
- mash/steep indicators on malt list


StrangeBrew Java Pro Features:
- water profiling
- carbonation
- refractometer utilities
- inventory tracking
- brewday timeline generation
- brew sessions (vs recipes)
- saved mash schedules

(StrangeBrew Java will be released under a "dual-license": a free 
Open Source version and a commercial "Pro" version that will 
include some additional functionality.)
