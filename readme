===============
 What is this?
===============

This is a "beta" release of StrangeBrew Java, which means it's
still in development and may have some bugs.  
Please use it for your brewday planning, and let us know
how you like it!

StrangeBrew Java is a Java port of the popular Windows homebrewing
software, StrangeBrew (www.strangebrew.ca).

========================
Recipes at bodensatz.com
========================

There is a repository of StrangeBrew recipes available for viewing and
download at www.bodensatz.com/sb, hosted by Alan McKay.  Please feel free
to download recipes to open with StrangeBrew Java.  However, please do not
upload StrangeBrew Java files to bodensatz.  This is "Beta" software, and
contains bugs, and the saved recipe file may cause problems for other users.

==========================
 Running StrangeBrew Java
==========================

Running StrangeBrew:
1. Unzip the sb_XXX.zip file (where XXX is the latest version, eg: "beta1").
Be sure to preserve the directory structure.
2. Type "java -jar StrangeBrew_fat.jar" at the command line.  Under Windows,
you can right-click this file, select "Open With > " and select a Java
installation. You can also just double-click the file, if ".jar" files
are associated with javaw.exe.  There's probably a Mac/Linux way to do this, 
but I don't know what it is.

NOTE: StrangeBrew loads data (ingredients, styles, etc) from:
src/ca/strangebrew/data/
When you unzip the file, be sure to preserve directory names, so
that StrangeBrew can find this data.

===============================
Extra help for running on Linux
===============================

These are notes from Scott Alfter via rec.crafts.brewing:

1) Make sure CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC is enabled in the kernel (built-in or
   module)...look in Executable file formats/Emulations -> Kernel support
   for MISC binaries.
2) Add the following to /etc/fstab:
   binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc defaults 0 0
3) Create /usr/bin/jexec with the following contents and make it executable
   by everybody:
   #!/bin/sh
   java -jar $*
4) Add the following to whatever script your distro provides for local
   customization (in Gentoo, it's /etc/conf.d/local.start):
   echo ':jarexec:M::PK\x03\x04::/usr/bin/jexec:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

When you reboot (or if you execute the preceding from a root prompt), you
can chmod 755 StrangeBrew_fat.jar and then run it with the following:

./StrangeBrew_fat.jar


==========
Files 
==========

The file you downloaded should contain these files (at least):
  * Strangebrew_fat.jar: a Fat Jar file which you can run (see above).  This
    file also contains the complete Java source for the application.  To
    view the source, decompress this file with an archive utility.
  * gpl.txt: the GPL license this software is distributed under
  * readme.txt: this file
  * src/ca/strangebrew/data: data files and the xslt files required 
    for exporting HTML and printing.  You can modify the xslt files if 
    you want to customize the look of the HTML.
  * help/: help files.  These files are under development.
  * recipes/: example recipe files in various formats.    
  * lib/: support files and libraries for the application from third parties.  
    Open each .jar file to view its particular license.


============
Required JRE
============

You require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your system to run
StrangeBrew.  It should run with versions 1.4 and up; I'm using
1.5.06. (See http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/index.jsp).  StrangeBrew has
been tested and runs on Linux, MacOS-X, and Windows.

============
Known Issues
============

* When importing recipes from StrangeBrew for Windows (1.8 or earlier),
fermentables that are sugars are incorrectly considered "grains".  Their
gravity contribution is calculated using the recipe efficiency, rather than
100%.  You should re-select the ingredient from the drop-down list to
re-set it to get the correct calculation.  Sugars are indicated by an *.
If the * doesn't appear before it's name, you should re-select it. 

==============
Reporting Bugs
==============

We're using the Sourceforge tracking feature to track bugs.  Please go to 
www.sourceforge.net/projects/strangebrew and click on "bugs" to view a list
of reported bugs.  If you've found one that's not there, please report it!

==========
What's New
==========

Beta 0.6
--------
New Features:
- New File > Copy to Clipboard sends the recipe to the system clipboard, so you can
  easily paste it into another application (such as an email message).
- Database files are now backed up before new ingredients are added.
- Hop and Fermentables tables are tweaked for easier viewing of ingredient names.
- The Fermentables table now has indicators for "Steep" and "Mashed".  A "Steeped" grain
  can be used in a partial mash or extract session by steeping in warm water - for example,
  crystal malt.  Mashed malts must be mashed.  If a fermentable is neither steeped nor
  mashed, it is considered a sugar, and is calculated as contributing 100% of its 
  potential.
- New BU:GU indicator on the Style tab (Bug 1489262).  
- File > Print now launches a web browser with a printable recipe output.
- Help now launches a web browser with some useless help.

Bugs Fixed:
- Numbers are now formatted according to local settings, which fixes a NumberFormatException
  on startup for some regional settings. 
- New notes now have a default date (current date), which prevents a crash when saving
  the recipe (Bug 1489273 & 1489269).  
- You can now specify the total target weight in different units (Bug 1489275).
- Date fields now have a date picker widget (Bug 1489264).
- The comments area is now smaller on the Misc tab (Bug 1489254).  
- Cost and carb boxes are larger on the Prefs dialog (Bug 1489251).
- You can now set the evaporation default value on the Prefs dialog (Bug 1489248).
- Various temperatures now convert correctly when you change the temp units 
  (Bug 1489257 and 1489279).
- Styles now sorted alphabetically (Bug 1490617).  
- Batch size now imports correctly.
- Hop and Fermentables now convert their amount and cost when you change the units.


Beta 0.5.1
----------
- Made compatible with 1.4 JREs.
- Water and mash tabs are now updated appropriately when data changes.

Beta 0.5
--------
- Some menu items now have keyboard shortcuts and pretty icons.
- You can now set default units for hops, malts, and volume, as well as default
  batch size.
- StrangeBrew now remembers its window size and location when you re-start.  
- You can now set the malt and hops units with a drop-down in the totals area.
- "New" ingredients are now detected when you open a recipe.  You can choose to
  add them permanently to your existing ingredient databases.  NOTE: this is currently
  just a comparison between the ingredient name and the list in the database, so 
  you could end up with two nearly identical ingredients (eg "pils malt" and 
  "pilsner malt").
  
Fixed in Beta 0.5:
- Hop and fermentable costs are calculated by using the units for the ingredient,
  not oz and lbs.
- Mash table now displays temps to only 1 decimal when you convert between F and C.
- The colour patch now displays correctly when the colour method is set to EBC.
- The colour patch now uses new RBG settings when you close the Preferences dialog.
- When you select "Save" or "Save As...", StrangeBrew now suggests a file name, and
  adds ".xml" to the file name for you.
- Fermentables that are not mashed or steeped are now read correctly from a saved
  file (bug 1483173).
- SB 1.8 and earlier recipes now import correctly (bug 1483523).
- XML entities are now saved correctly in descriptions (bug 1483143).    
- The misc. ingredients in Promash recipes are now read.
- Values no longer are "jumping" around when you click in different fields on the 
  water tab.
- XML import is improved so that malt and hop names aren't occasionally truncated.  


Beta 0.4
--------
- You can now import Promash and BeerXML (BeerSmith) recipes.  Just select
  the file from the "Open" dialog.  Note: not all Promash data is imported. 
  This is a short list of items not read: misc ingredients; decoction steps;
  style data; water details; custom mash schedules.
  BeerXML files can contain multiple recipes; using File > Open opens just
  the last recipe in the file.  When you point the Find dialog at a directory
  containing a BeerXML file with multiple recipes, all the recipes show up in the
  list.  Use this dialog to select other recipes in a BeerXML file.
- The cost panel is now fully implemented.  
- The colour preferences are now fully implemented.  Depending on your system,
  one of RGB calculation methods may work better than the other.
- New Resize Dialog to scale your recipe. Note: With some IBU estimation methods
  (Tinseth and Garetz), IBUs change slightly on resize - this will be fixed in 
  a future release.
- Example recipes and data files are now located two different locations.  
- The UI now uses the JGoodies Plastic3D Look and Feel.


  
=========
 Roadmap
=========

Soon-to-be Implemented Features:
- mash tun thermal mass
- hop scaling
- specify decoction thickness value
- real application help (not the SB Win version)
- sparge calculations (fly and batch)
- printing support (?)
- refractometer utilities
- save / load mash profiles

Planned StrangeBrew Java Pro Features:
- water profiling
- carbonation
- inventory tracking
- brewday timeline generation
- brew sessions (vs recipes)
- saved mash schedules
- alternate malt/hop selection dialog
- ingredient database editing

(StrangeBrew Java will be released under a "dual-license": a free 
Open Source version and a commercial "Pro" version that will 
include some additional functionality.)
